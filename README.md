# VRCodingExample
Coding example for a VR Interactive Menu

Please check out the files in Assets/Scripts for examples of my coding.

It's also worth noting that I wrote these scripts in about an hour, so they're not perfect! I'm going to update this project at a later date with more refined examples as and when I am able to. As it stands, most of my code is under NDA and my personal projects don't show examples of clean code written to be shared with a team...
